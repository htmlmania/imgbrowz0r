ImgBrowz0r changelog
http://61924.nl/projects/imgbrowz0r.html

0.3.5 - February 12th, 2010:

 - Renamed index.php to example.php.
 - Fixed directory traversal vulnerability. Fixed by bc.
 - *_sort_order options need different values. See example.php for information.
 - Some small optimizations (e.g. scandir instead of readdir).
 - Removed the filesize_limit option. This slowsdown everything and a user should
   be able to check his/her photos or other images before he puts them online.

0.3.4 - September 10th, 2009:

 - Replaced str_replace() with preg_quote() for regex escaping.
 - Added separate sorting options for images and directories.
 - Made private methods/variables protected to make extending easier.
 - Added filesize limit option.
 - Added (preview) thumbnail generation for directories.
 - Changed markup for thumbnails. It'll be easier to style it with CSS.
 - Added memory peak usage to the example page (index.php). Now you can
   see how much memory GD (not ImgBrowz0r) uses.

0.3.3 - June 29th, 2009:

 - Fixed a bug in the url generation for directories.
 - Directory names can now contain UTF-8 characters (tested with: 東京).
   Umlaut and stress and accent marks do work now.
 - Added character blacklist for directory names: < > " ' & ;

0.3.2 - June 14th, 2009:

 - Breadcrumbs do not obey ['main_url']. Fixed by burnthewitches.

0.3.1 - June 7th, 2009:

 - Added imgbrowz0r::description() to display a description. See README for more info.
 - Statistics are not shown in an empty directory.

0.3 - April 30th, 2009:

 - The functions that generate the navigation are removed from imgbrowz0r::display()
   and are now public functions.
 - Fixed a small bug in the url check part.
 - Added the random thumbnails again.
 - "Random thumbnails" can also be disabled now. Instead the same thumbnail will
   be shown each time or nothing at all.
 - Added a "read limit" that limits the amount of thumbnails that are used for the
   random thumbnail fucntion (this can speed things up).
 - Thumbnails are now refreshed if the orginal image has changed.
 - The supported file types are now stored in a variable.
 - Fixed a bug in imgbrowz0r::get_ext().
 - Fixed a bug in directory check in imgbrowz0r::make_thumb().

 - Cleaned up page navigation generator.

   in imgbrowz0r::make_thumb().
