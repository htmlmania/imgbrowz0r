http://61924.nl/projects/imgbrowz0r.html


0.3.7 - 22 July 2010:

 - Added "sort by EXIF DateTimeOriginal". Patch provided by bc.
 - Replaced scandir() with DirectoryIterator.
 - The timezone configuration option now accepts a valid TZ database timezone
   or `false`. When `false` is used the timezone setting will be skipped.
 - The enable_dst configuration option has been dropped.
 - Do not check if GD is enabled anymore.
 - Renamed the `imgbrowz0r` class to `ImgBrowz0r`.
 - Added small, optional, replaceable caching class.
 - A better pagination function.
 - Use P tags instead of DIV tags to wrap the breadcrumbs, pagination and statistics.
 - All files in the cache are now writeable by everyone. This ensures you can
   remove the cache files generated by the PHP/Apache user with your FTP client.
 - Added crop mode. This mode crops a random part of the image. (experimental)

0.3.6 - 16 February 2010:

 - Fixed directory traversal vulnerability (again). Reported by Secunia Research.


0.3.5 - 12 February 2010:

 - Renamed index.php to example.php.
 - Fixed directory traversal vulnerability. Fixed by bc.
 - *_sort_order options need different values. See example.php for information.
 - Some small optimizations (e.g. scandir instead of readdir).
 - Removed the filesize_limit option. This slowsdown everything and a user should
   be able to check his/her photos or other images before he puts them online.


0.3.4 - 10 September 2009:

 - Replaced str_replace() with preg_quote() for regex escaping.
 - Added separate sorting options for images and directories.
 - Made private methods/variables protected to make extending easier.
 - Added filesize limit option.
 - Added (preview) thumbnail generation for directories.
 - Changed markup for thumbnails. It'll be easier to style it with CSS.
 - Added memory peak usage to the example page (index.php). Now you can
   see how much memory GD (not ImgBrowz0r) uses.


0.3.3 - 29 June 2009:

 - Fixed a bug in the url generation for directories.
 - Directory names can now contain UTF-8 characters (tested with: 東京).
   Umlaut and stress and accent marks do work now.
 - Added character blacklist for directory names: < > " ' & ;


0.3.2 - 14 June 2009:

 - Breadcrumbs do not obey ['main_url']. Fixed by burnthewitches.


0.3.1 - 7 June 2009:

 - Added imgbrowz0r::description() to display a description. See README for more info.
 - Statistics are not shown in an empty directory.
 - Cleaned up code.


0.3 - 30 April 2009:

 - The functions that generate the navigation are removed from imgbrowz0r::display()
   and are now public functions.
 - Fixed a small bug in the url check part.
 - Added the random thumbnails again.
 - "Random thumbnails" can also be disabled now. Instead the same thumbnail will
   be shown each time or nothing at all.
 - Added a "read limit" that limits the amount of thumbnails that are used for the
   random thumbnail fucntion (this can speed things up).
 - Thumbnails are now refreshed if the orginal image has changed.
 - The supported file types are now stored in a variable.
 - Fixed a bug in imgbrowz0r::get_ext().
 - Fixed a bug in directory check in imgbrowz0r::make_thumb().
 - Directory statistics now in a  separate function, imgbrowz0r::statistics().
 - Removed check if GD extension is loaded. gd_info() function check is enough.
 - Removed imgbrowz0r::output_style().
 - Cleaned up page navigation generator.
 - Replaced some hard-coded values for the thumbnail height and width with variables
   in imgbrowz0r::make_thumb().
