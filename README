# Get it running

 - Make two directories named "images" and "cache" in the ImgBrowz0r directory.
 - Make "cache" writable.
 - Drop some images and directories in "images".

That's a really basic setup. It's recommended to play with the condiguration
and try various things (url rewriting, CMS integration, etc.).

Information about certain things.

## read_thumb_limit

When the "random thumbnail" function is enabled it reads the cache of the current
category/directory to choose a random thumbnail. If there are a lot thumbnails in
the cache it will take more time to read all the files in the cache.

You can set this to 10 to speedup the process, but it will only choose a random
thumbnail of out 10.
