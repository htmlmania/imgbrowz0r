ImgBrowz0r
==========

ImgBrowz0r is a class written in PHP5 (tested with 5.2.9) that enables you to set up
a simple gallery with basic configuration in 10 minutes. It's also possible to integrate
it into a CMS or your existing website. You can also configure various other things like
sorting order and thumbnail sizes (etc. etc.).

It does things like generating thumbnails, generating pagination/breadcrumbs and outputs
XHTML that has sufficient classes and ID's to make it easy to adjust and extend everything
with CSS and Javascript.

The only thing you have to do is install it and upload your images and you're done. And
maybe clean the cache once in a while.

Features
========

 - Infinite nesting of directories.
 - Automatic thumbnail creation and caching.
 - Thumbnail is refreshed if the orginal image is changed.
 - Transparency in PNG and GIF images is preserved in the thumbnail.
 - Valid XHTML 1.0 Strict output.
 - Easy to integrate into any website or CMS.
 - Easy to style and extend with CSS and Javascript.
 - Ability to configure time display and timezone.
 - Represent a directory with a (random) thumbnail.
 - Sorting of images and directories can be configured.
 - Tableless based layout for the gallery.
 - Images (and the cache) can be stored on different locations/(sub)domains on the
   server as long it's reachable by the browser.
 - Support for gif, jpg, jpeg, jpe, jif, jfif, jfi and png images.
 - Page navigation and breadcrumbs.
 - File information and output caching to speed everything up.
 - Reads Exif date from Jpeg images when possible (and use it for sorting).

Requirements
============

 - PHP 5.2
 - GD
 - Exif (optional)

Exif is most likely enabled in most PHP installations. See the PHP manual for
more information: http://php.net/manual/en/exif.installation.php

Installation
============

 - Drop the files from this package into a web accessible directory.
 - Make two directories named "images" and "cache" in the ImgBrowz0r directory.
 - Make "cache" directory writable (linux command: `chmod -R 0777 cache`).
 - Drop some images and directories in "images" directory.

That's a really basic setup. It's recommended to play with the configuration
and try various things (url rewriting, CMS integration, etc.).

Extra information
=================

Information about certain things.

  - Character blacklist

    Certain characters are not allowed in directory names.

    < > " ' & ; .. %

  - read_thumb_limit

    When the "random thumbnail" function is enabled it reads the cache of the current
    category/directory to choose a random thumbnail. If there are a lot thumbnails in
    the cache it will take more time to read all the files in the cache.

    You can set this to 10 to speedup the process, but it will only choose a random
    thumbnail of out the 10 first files it reads from the thumbnail cache.

  - Description for directories

    With imgbrowz0r::description() you can search for a description in the currently
    viewed directory. The function return the content of the description file when it
    found it and "null" is returned when nothing is found.

    You can add a description to a directory by adding a .desc file in the directory
    and put your description in that file.

    Html tags are stripped from the description except the following tags:
    <p>, <strong>, <em>, <a>, <br />, <h1>, <h2> and <h3>

     - Use valid HTML in your description to avoid unexpected behaviour.
     - Look for more info at:
       http://php.net/manual/en/function.strip-tags.php

  - Caching

    A small caching class, `ImgBrowz0rCache`, is provided with ImgBrowz0r. An instance
    of this class is passed to the ImgBrowz0r constructor to let ImgBrowz0r use the
    function of the caching class (see example.php for an example).

    This class can easily be replaced with an other cache as long as the other class
    has a public write and read method.

    A skeleton of of a caching class for ImgBrowz0r:

    class AlternativeImgBrowz0rCache
    {
        public function read($name)
        {
        }

        public function write($name, $data)
        {
        }
    }

    $name is the filename without the extension. The class must decide which extension
    to use. $data is an array. The read method must return the same array which was cached.
