# Introduction

ImgBrowz0r if a class written in PHP5 (tested with 5.2.9) that enables you to set up
a simple gallery with basic configuration to 10 minutes. It's also possible to integrate
it into a CMS or your existing website. You can also change various other things like
sorting order and thumbnail sizes (etc. etc.).

It does things like generating thumbnails, generating pagination/breadcrumbs and outputs
XHTML that is provided with classes and ID's so everything can be extended and changed
with Javascript and CSS.

The only thing you have to do is install it and upload your images. And maybe clean
the cache once in a while.

# Features

 - Infinite nesting of directories.
 - Automatic thumbnail creation and caching.
 - Thumbnail is refreshed if the orginal image is changed.
 - Transparency in PNG and GIF images is preserved in the thumbnail.
 - Valid XHTML 1.0 Strict output.
 - Easy to integrate into any website or CMS.
 - Easy to style and extend with CSS and Javascript.
 - Ability to configure time display, timezone and DST.
 - Represent a directory with a (random) thumbnail.
 - Sorting of images can be configured.
 - Div (<div>) based layout for the gallery.
 - Images (and the cache) can be stored on different locations/(sub)domains on the
   server as long it's reachable by the browser.
 - Support for gif, jpg, jpeg, jpe, jif, jfif, jfi and png images.
 - Page navigation and breadcrumbs.

# Get it running

 - Drop the files from this package into a web accessible directory.
 - Make two directories named "images" and "cache" in the ImgBrowz0r directory.
 - Make "cache" writable (linux command: chmod -R 0777 cache).
 - Drop some images and directories in "images".

That's a really basic setup. It's recommended to play with the condiguration
and try various things (url rewriting, CMS integration, etc.).

# Extra information

Information about certain things.

  ## read_thumb_limit

  When the "random thumbnail" function is enabled it reads the cache of the current
  category/directory to choose a random thumbnail. If there are a lot thumbnails in
  the cache it will take more time to read all the files in the cache.

  You can set this to 10 to speedup the process, but it will only choose a random
  thumbnail of out 10.
