# Get it running

 - Make two directories named "images" and "cache" in the ImgBrowz0r directory.
 - Make "cache" writable.
 - Drop some images and directories in "images".

That's a really basic setup. It's recommended to play with the condiguration
and try various things (url rewriting, CMS integration, etc.).
