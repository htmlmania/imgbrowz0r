ImgBrowz0r
==========

ImgBrowz0r is a class written in PHP5 (tested with 5.2.9) that enables you to set up
a simple gallery with basic configuration in 10 minutes. It's also possible to integrate
it into a CMS or your existing website. You can also configure various other things like
sorting order and thumbnail sizes (etc. etc.).

It does things like generating thumbnails, generating pagination/breadcrumbs and outputs
XHTML that is provided with classes and ID's so everything can be extended and changed
with Javascript and CSS.

The only thing you have to do is install it and upload your images. And maybe clean
the cache once in a while.

Features
========

 - Infinite nesting of directories.
 - Automatic thumbnail creation and caching.
 - Thumbnail is refreshed if the orginal image is changed.
 - Transparency in PNG and GIF images is preserved in the thumbnail.
 - Valid XHTML 1.0 Strict output.
 - Easy to integrate into any website or CMS.
 - Easy to style and extend with CSS and Javascript.
 - Ability to configure time display, timezone and DST.
 - Represent a directory with a (random) thumbnail.
 - Sorting of images can be configured.
 - Div (<div>) based layout for the gallery.
 - Images (and the cache) can be stored on different locations/(sub)domains on the
   server as long it's reachable by the browser.
 - Support for gif, jpg, jpeg, jpe, jif, jfif, jfi and png images.
 - Page navigation and breadcrumbs.

Installation
============

 - Drop the files from this package into a web accessible directory.
 - Make two directories named "images" and "cache" in the ImgBrowz0r directory.
 - Make "cache" writable (linux command: chmod -R 0777 cache).
 - Drop some images and directories in "images".

That's a really basic setup. It's recommended to play with the condiguration
and try various things (url rewriting, CMS integration, etc.).

Extra information
=================

Information about certain things.

  - Character blacklist

    Certain characters are not allowed in directory names.

    < > " ' & ;

  - read_thumb_limit

    When the "random thumbnail" function is enabled it reads the cache of the current
    category/directory to choose a random thumbnail. If there are a lot thumbnails in
    the cache it will take more time to read all the files in the cache.

    You can set this to 10 to speedup the process, but it will only choose a random
    thumbnail of out 10.

  - Description for directories

    With imgbrowz0r::description() you can search for a description in the currently
    viewed directory. The function return the content of the description file when it
    found it and "null" is returned when nothing is found.

    You can add a description to a directory by adding a .desc file in the directory
    and put your description in that file.

    Html tags are stripped from the description except the following tags:
    <p>, <strong>, <em>, <a>, <br />, <h1>, <h2> and <h3>

     - Use valid HTML in your description to avoid unexpected behaviour.
