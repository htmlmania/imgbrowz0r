<=0.3.6 --> 0.3.7
=================

0.3.7 has some changes in its configuration which makes it incompatible with
previous versions.

 - The ImgBrowz0r class has been renamed to 'ImgBrowz0r' from 'imgbrowz0r'.
   Make sure you apply this change to all scripts where ImgBrowz0r is used.

 - The timezone configuration option does not accept a number anymore. Instead
   it needs a timezone string from the tz database. The list with timezones can
   be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones

 - The enable_dst configuration option has been dropped, because the timezone
   option takes care of this now (automatically).

 - There are some minor changes in the CSS. Take a look at the example.php file
   to see what has been changed.
